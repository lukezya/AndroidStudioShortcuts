# Android Studio Shortcuts

Android Studio Shortcuts is an Android app designed to help developers learn and master the keyboard shortcuts in Android Studio, enabling faster and more efficient coding. The app showcases a lazy list view implemented using Jetpack Compose. Each element in the list is a card that displays a shortcut and provides a dropdown button.
